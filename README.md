The goal of this project was to classify celestial objects into three categories—stars, 
galaxies, and quasars—using spectroscopic data. These objects can appear similar visually, but 
they differ significantly in their size, structure, and distances. Machine learning techniques, 
particularly classification models, were  employed to identify these celestial objects based on 
their spectral characteristics.
